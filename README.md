# User-Defined-String-Functions

In this program, we will be performing string operations like concat, copy, length & compare by using user-defined functions for each operation:
my_strlen(): This function counts how many characters are in the string before the null terminator.\n
my_strcpy(): This function duplicates a string from one location (Source) to another (Destination).\n
my_strcmp(): This function compares two strings character by character to see if they are identical.\n
my_strcat():  This function appends one string to the end of another.\n
We will be implementing these functions as a password manager simulator, where the user will be able to set their new password, generate a strong password, check its validity & correctness.
